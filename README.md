# General #

Javascript tooling that aggregated data from https://data.gov.lv/dati/lv/dataset/gada-parskatu-finansu-dati and generates different kinds of top lists per various metrics

# TODOs #

- Download the needed input csv files if not present or stale
- Check sorting
- Dump all data as xls or something else (since the top functionality can be easily done in a spreadsheet once the data has been aggregated)
- Understand how to group the data (NACE classification is not available?)
